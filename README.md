# Windows-Wi-Fi-Manager
This Desktop Application finds out all the saved Wi-Fi from your window system and displays the Wi-Fi details of specific Wi-Fi profile (SSID name, Authentication, Password). I know it is simple to get the password by just using CMD and typing commands like 'netsh wlan show profile name = "&lt;profile name>" key=clear" but that's not everyone is familiar with and you have to manually type the SSID name of the profile and for some profile like 'Mr.N=" you will get the result 'Profile "Mr. N=key=clear" is not found on the system'. The issue with this profile is '=' at the end of the SSID name, had you ever think if some SSID contains emojis how will you type it in CMD, but my application will list out all the saved Wi-Fi in sorted order and you just had to scroll down and choose the name of the Wi-Fi of whom you want to get the details and you will get all info of that profile including Security Key (Password). The other benefit of this application is that you can save the SSID name, Authentication, and Password of that profile and when your system comes in Wi-Fi range of that profile, it will automatically get connected to that network. If your system is flooded with too much of Wi-Fi profiles, without going to CMD and selecting the SSID name and then typing dozens of command, you can delete in one click by selecting the Wi-Fi profile in the list and press delete button. Download and install the application and you will know what I want to say. The Application code is in python programming language and I use Tkinter GUI framework.
